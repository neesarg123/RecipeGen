TITLE: Peanut Butter Potato Power Bowl

Ingredients:
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon grated ginger
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Mixed greens or spinach, for serving
- Optional toppings: diced cucumber, shredded carrots, sliced scallions, chopped peanuts

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the sliced potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and drizzle with a small amount of olive oil. Toss to coat evenly, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are crispy and golden brown.

2. In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, minced garlic, grated ginger, salt, and pepper until smooth. If needed, add a splash of warm water to achieve your desired consistency.

3. Once the potatoes are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly. Place a bed of mixed greens or spinach in a serving bowl or plate.

4. Arrange the crispy potatoes on top of the greens, and drizzle the peanut butter sauce over them. If desired, add toppings such as diced cucumber, shredded carrots, sliced scallions, or chopped peanuts for extra flavor and crunch.

5. Serve immediately and enjoy your Peanut Butter Potato Power Bowl!
